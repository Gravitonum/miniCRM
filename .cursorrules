# Agent Behavior Rules

## Terminal Execution Restrictions
- **DO NOT** attempt to use the `run_command` tool or any other tool that executes commands in the terminal.
- Terminal execution is known to hang on this system. 
- If a command needs to be run, provide the exact command to the user in a message and ask them to run it manually in the IDE terminal.
- Always explain that you are asking the user to run the command because your internal terminal tool is disabled by these rules.

## Preferred Workflow
1. Write/modify code.
2. Provide the user with any necessary terminal commands (e.g., `npm run dev`, `pytest`, `pip install`).
3. Wait for the user to provide the output of those commands before proceeding.
